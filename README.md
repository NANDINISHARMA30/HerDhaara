Udaan(AI-Powered Learning & Earning Platform for Rural Women)

Concept:
 A smart, AI-driven platform that discovers women’s skills, upskills them, and links them directly to fair, safe work opportunities—especially for women from rural or underserved communities.

 This project aims to empower rural women by giving them one digital space to learn, earn, showcase their talents, and receive emotional support—helping them become financially independent, confident, and more visible to real opportunities.
